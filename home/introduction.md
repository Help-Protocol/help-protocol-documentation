## What is Help Protocol?

**Help Protocol** will be the world's first decentralized reserve **karma** protocol available on **Terra blockchain.** \[Here the word Karma refers to a Sanskrit word that means action, work, or deed. The term also refers to the [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality) principle of [cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause\_and\_effect), often descriptively called the **principle of karma**, wherein intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect):[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma#cite\_note-2) Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and this protocol acts as a reserve of all those good deeds and rewards them accordingly].

Each **KARMA** token is backed by a basket of assets(help assets) in the **Help Network** treasury, giving it an intrinsic value it cannot fall below.

## What is the point of Help Protocol?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled **karma** system, which supports philanthropy actions by the community and rewards the donors. WIth **Help Protocol** even small donations and create exponential impact over time.

In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that **$KARMA** can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-donation currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and community creation, everyone helping everyone because we believe KARMA IS REAL.

We intend to achieve price flatness for a representative basket of goods without the use of fiat currency, in order to allow philanthropy to detach once and for all from the traditional finance world!

## How do I participate in Help Protocol? <a href="how-do-i-participate-in-olympus" id="how-do-i-participate-in-olympus"></a>

There are two main strategies for market participants: **staking** and minting. Stakers stake their **KARMA** tokens in return for more **KARMA** tokens, while minters provide LP tokens in exchange for discounted **KARMA** tokens after a fixed vesting period.

## How can I benefit from Help Protocol? <a href="how-can-i-benefit-from-olympus" id="how-can-i-benefit-from-olympus"></a>

The main benefit for pledge takers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new **$KARMA** tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers(pledge takers). Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for minters comes from price consistency. Minters commit capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is given in **$KARMA** tokens and thus the minter's profit would depend on **token **price when the minted $KARMA matures. Taking this into consideration, minters benefit from a rising or static price for the **$KARMA** token!
